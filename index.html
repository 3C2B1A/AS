<p style="font-size: 21px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.About Me.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I’ve recently finished my ICS (Intermediate in Computer Science). Instead of jumping straight into university like most people, I decided to take a gap year to figure out what career path feels right for me. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been really into tech and electronics. I used to love taking apart my toys just to see how they worked. Pretty much every toy I got ended up getting a little “surgery” from me! That curiosity is what’s driving me to explore a career in tech.
